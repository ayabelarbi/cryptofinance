## 📚 Completed Sections

### 1. Statistics ✅
- **1.1 Hash Function Distribution**: Analysis of hash function uniformity using statistical tests
- **1.2 Proof-of-Work Duration**: Empirical validation of exponential distribution in mining times

### 2. Mining Strategies ✅
- **2.1 Strategy 1+2 Simulation**: Numerical evaluation and comparison with theoretical formulas
- **2.2 Selfish Mining**: Performance analysis with parameters (q, γ) representing hashing power and connectivity
- **2.3 Optimal Selfish Mining**: Dynamic decision-making based on fork states (a, h)

### 3. Bitcoin Thresholds ✅ **[NEW]**
- **3.1 Orphan Block Mining**: Determination of profitability thresholds for mining on orphan blocks
  - Theoretical threshold: √2 - 1 ≈ 0.4142 (41.42%)
  - Visualization of yield curves and profitability zones
- **3.2 Block Withholding (γ=0)**: Analysis of rational miner behavior with zero connectivity
  - Numerical verification of threshold using scipy.optimize
  - Comparative analysis with orphan mining strategy
  - Security implications for Bitcoin network

#### Key Finding (Section 3)
Both strategies share the **same profitability threshold**: a miner with more than **41.42%** of network hash power has economic incentive to deviate from honest mining. This reveals a fundamental security threshold in Bitcoin's consensus mechanism.

## 🔒 Security Implications

Our analysis in Section 3 reveals critical insights:
- Bitcoin's security relies on no miner controlling >41.42% of hash power
- Economic incentives for centralization exist above this threshold
- Network connectivity (γ) plays a crucial role in strategy profitability
- Current Bitcoin mining pool distribution maintains safe margins
